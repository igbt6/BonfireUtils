1. They said I was nothing but a troublemaker never up to no good
You were the perfect all American girl wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window everynight riding shotgun in my car
We go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

2. So you went off to college and I got a job I was working that 9 to 5
Dreaming of the days when you were in my arms I've never felt so alive
I spent my days working, spent my nights drinking, howling at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back, no couldn't come to soon
Couldn't come to soon

<b>REF:</b> 
When I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better

But I was what you wanted and you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen
{eoc}

Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee, and I said:
