1. Whoa I, I just wanna ease your mind
Put your doubts to bed tonight
Lay down and let me tell you
You're, you're the kind of once in our lives
That lock it down don't come around twice
I guess what I'm sayin'
This heart of mine ain't playin'

{soc}
<b>REF:</b> 
If you were this guitar, I'd turn it to eleven
If you were an angel, I'd pray to go to heaven
If they wouldn't let me in, I'd break the gates down
I'd break 'em all down
If you were on the other side of the world
I'd spin that thing right back around just to get to you girl
I love the way you always go and mess me up
If you were a whiskey, girl, I'd be a damn drunk
{eoc}

2. Oh hey, go on and roll those pretty blue eyes
Laugh and say boy you lie
Girl I wouldn't dare
Dare to make you love me more
I can take that on for sure
'Cause what we got is crazy, crazy good
