1. You held me up, held me down
Made me crazy, then you brought me around
Were my darkness and my light
You were my blindness and my sight
Were my shelter and my storm
Made me cold then you made me warm
You were my fever and my cure
Made me doubt then you made me sure

<b>REF:</b> 
One step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets too far like that
One step forward and two steps back
This kind of dance can never last
{eoc}

2. You were my hope and my fears
You were my laughter and my tears
Were my destiny and my fate
Kept me movin', you made me wait
Were my weakness and my power
You were the thorn and the flower
You were my sunshine and the rain
Made me feel so good, brought so much pain.
