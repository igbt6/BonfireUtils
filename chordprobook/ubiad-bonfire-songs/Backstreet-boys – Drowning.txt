1. Don't pretend you're sorry 
I know you're not 
You know you got the power 
To make me weak inside 
Girl, you leave me breathless 
But it's okay 
'Cause you are my survival 
Now hear me say... 
I can't imagine life without your love 
And even forever don't seem like long enough 

{soc}
<b>REF:</b> 
Every time I breathe I take you in 
And my heart beats again 
Baby, I can't help it 
Keep me drowning in your love 
Every time I try to rise above 
I'm swept away by love 
Baby, I can't help it 
Keep me drowning in your love 
{eoc}

2. Maybe I'm a drifter 
Maybe not 
'Cause I have known the safety 
Of floating freely in your arms 
I don't need another lifeline 
It's not for me 'Cause only you can save me 
Oh, can't you see.
I can't imagine life without your love 
And even forever don't seem like long enough 
(Don't seem like 
long enough, yeah)

3. Go on and pull me under 
Cover me with dreams, yeah 
Love me mouth-to-mouth now
You know I can't resist 
'Cause you're the air that I breathe.
