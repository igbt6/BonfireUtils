1. Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine 
I'm leaving my life in your hands 
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind 
Risking it all in a glance 
 How you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in you history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are 
Where you're from 
What you did 
As long as you love me 
Who you are 
Where you're from 
Don't care what you did 
As long as you love me
{eoc}

2. Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be 
 I've tried to hide it so that no one knows 
But I guess it shows 
When you look in to my eyes 
What you did and where you're comin from 
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby.
