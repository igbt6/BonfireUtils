1. Day after day, time pass away
And I just can't get you off my mind
Nobody knows, I hide it inside
I keep on searching, but I can't find
The courage to show, to letting you know
I've never felt so much love before
And once again, I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out.

But if I let you go, I will never know
What my life would be, holding you close to me
Will I ever see, you smiling back at me
Oh yeah
How will I know
If I let you go

2. Night after night, I hear myself say
Why can't this feeling just fade away
There's no-one like you, you speak to my heart
It's such a shame, we're worlds apart
I'm too shy to ask, I'm too proud to loose
But sooner or later, I gotta choose
And once again, I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out.
