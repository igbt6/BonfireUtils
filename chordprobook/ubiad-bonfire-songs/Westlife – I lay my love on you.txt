1. Just a smile and the rain is gone
Can hardly believe it (yeah)
There's an angel standing next to me
Reaching for my heart
 Just a smile and there's no way back
Can hardly believe it (yeah)
But there's an angel, she's calling me
Reaching for my heart
 I know, that I'll be ok now
This time it's real

<b>REF:</b> 
I lay my love on you
It's all I wanna do
Everytime I breathe I feel brand new
You open up my heart
Show me all your love, and walk right through
As I lay my love on you.
{eoc}

2. I was lost in a lonely place
Could hardly even believe it (yeah)
Holding on to yesterdays
Far, far too long
Now I believe its ok cause this time it's real.

3. I never knew that love could fell soo good
Like once in a lifetime
You change my world
