1. Thanks for calling, it's so good to hear your voice
You keep breaking up, in all the static and the noise
But I'll keep listening 'cause I never had a choice
When it came to you.
I'd love to see you, if you ever out this way
You sound happy, guess things are working out okay
And I'm getting better by putting one foot
In front of the other.
And I know that California is not to blame
And I know there's millions of people in L.A.

But if you ever get lonely, if you miss me
If you need someone to listen, even if it's only the sound
Of someone's voice who loves you that you need to hear
You know where to find me, if you ever get lonely
{eoc}

2. Sounds like a good time, going down at the other end
You got a new life and a new love, and a whole new set of friends
And are you listening? Do you expect me to pretend
That I don't love you, I don't love you?

Were you ever really listening, were you ever really there?
