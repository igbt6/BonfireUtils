1. Hmm, yeah, yeah 
Baby, please try to forgive me 
Stay here don't put out the glow 
Hold me now don't bother if every minute it makes me weaker 
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah

<b>REF:</b> 
Lookin' back on the things I've done 
I was tryin' to be someone 
I played my part, kept you in the dark 
Now let me show you the shape of my heart 
{eoc}

2. Sadness is beautiful, Loneliness that's tragical 
So help me I can't win this war, oh no.
Touch me now don't bother if every second it makes me weaker 
You can save me from the man I've become

3. I'm here with my confesion 
Got nothing to hide no more 
I dont know where to start 
But to show you the shape of my heart.

4. I'm lookin' back on things I've done 
I never wanna play the same old part 
Or keep you in the dark 
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
